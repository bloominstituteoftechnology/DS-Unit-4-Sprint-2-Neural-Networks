    "- **Neuron:** A neuron is the fundamental building block of a neural network. It consists of a set of weights (used to generate a weighted sum of inputs) and an activation, or transfer, function (run on the aforementioned weighted sum to produce an output).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Input Layer:** Neurons in the first, or input, layer of a neural network contain a number weights equal to the number of external inputs, bias term included.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Hidden Layer:** Every neural network does not contain a hidden layer, although most do, and this is necessary for complete classification of problems that are not linearly separable. Nodes in a hidden layer contain a number of weights equal to the number of nodes in the previous layer, plus an optional bias term. ReLU activation functions are very commonly used in hidden layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Output Layer:** Neurons in the output layer of a neural network contain a number of weights equal to the number of neurons in the preceding layer, plus an optional bias term. Many networks have only a single output neuron, although some may have more. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Activation:** The activation function of a neuron transforms the weighted sum it calculates into an output (generally with some given set of properties). Common activation functions include the sigmoid and tanh functions, as well as the ReLU family of functions. The identity function can also be considered an activation function!\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Backpropagation:** Just as a neural network propagates information about its inputs *forward* through its layers, so it propagates information about the error as compared with a target output *backward* through those same layers. This allows the weights in those layers to be updated little by little, gradually reducing the error produced by the network."
