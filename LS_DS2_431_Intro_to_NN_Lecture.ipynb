        "Neural Networks are a whole new area of study and application that can be intimidating, but which represents some of the most powerful tools and techniques that we possess in machine learning today. In spite of the hype surrounding these topics I hope that you will come to see them as just another tool in your toolbag with their own strengths and weaknesses. They are useful, but they are not a silver bullet, and they are not always preferable to other -perhaps more simple- machine learning methods. \n",
        "\n",
        "The goal of this week is to familiarize you with the fundamental theory, terminology and libraries that will enable you to approach different neural network architectures (called topologies) in a sophisticated manner. This week will not be a run-through of the history of Neural Networks and each of the individual advancements leading up to current technologies -we don't have time for that. We will spend some time on some older methods, but only to the degree that they will help introduce us to relevant terminology and understand more complex versions of these technologies."

        "Artificial Neural Networks are a computational model that was inspired by how neural networks in the brain process information. In the brain electrochemical signals flow from earlier neurons through the dendrites of the cell toward the cell body. If the received signals surpass a certain threshold with a given timing then the neuron fires sending a large spike of energy down the axon and through the axon terminals to other neurons down the line. \n",

Remember that ANNs are not brains. Don't fall into the common trap of assuming that if an Artificial Neural Network has as many nodes as the human brain that it will be just as powerful or just as capable. The goal with ANNs is not to create a realistic model of the brain but to craft robust algorithms and data structures that can model the complex relationships found in data."

The simplest possible network is to have a single neuron in the hidden layer that just outputs the value. \"Deep Learning\" apart from being a big buzzword simply means that we are using a Neural Network that has multiple hidden layers. \"Deep Learning\" is a big part of the renewed hype around ANNs because it allows networks that are structured in specific ways to accomplish tasks that were previously out of reach (image recognition for example).  \n",

We can turn this into a class-specific prediction by rounding the outputted sigmoid probability up to 1 or down to 0. \n",

        "Now, we didn't fit this line using any regression techniques so it's likely that it's **not** the line of best fit. But we could try out other lines and see if the error gets bigger or smaller. Well it just so happens that in this two dimensional world that if our line is stuck to the origin on one end then we don't have all of the freedom that we want to control our predictions. We need some way to slide it up and down the y axis so that we can make any line that we want in this two-dimensional world. This y-intercept is a constant value, or in other words it's always weighted by 1. We're going to call this y-intercept our \"bias\" term. We'll define this a little bit better in a minute. \n",
