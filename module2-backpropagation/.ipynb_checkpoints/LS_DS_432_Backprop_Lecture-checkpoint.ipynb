    "\n",
    "Yesterday we talked about the capabilities and limitations of individual perceptrons.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Perceptrons are like a single neuron in a neural network\n",
    "- Perceptrons can only fit linear boundaries between classes\n",
    "\n",
    "What is a Feedforward Neural Network? Well, it's a Neural Network made up of multiple perceptrons that has at least 1 hidden layer (does not include input and output layers). When we use the [Tensorflow Playground](https://playground.tensorflow.org) website to explore different neural network architectures, we're really just composing different architectures (topologies) of feedforward neural networks. However, when we give the network multiple hidden layers it should be designated as a \"deep\" feedforward neural network.\n",

    "## Calculating *\"loss\"* or *\"error\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "We've talked about how in order to evaluate a network's performance, the data is \"fed forward\" until predictions are obtained and then the \"loss\" or \"error\" for a given observation is ascertained by looking at what the network predicted for that observation and comparing it to what it *should* have predicted. \n",
    "\n",
    "The error for a given observation is calculated by taking the square of the difference between the predicted value and the actual value. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can summarize the overal quality of a network's predictions by finding the average error across all observations. This gives us the \"Mean Squared Error.\" which hopefully is a fairly familiar model evaluation metric by now. Graphing the MSE over each epoch (training cycle) is a common practice with Neural Networks. This is what you're seeing in the top right corner of the Tensorflow Playground website as the number of \"epochs\" climbs higher and higher.\n",

    "We also graphed loss over a number of iterations when working with gradient descent. Neural Networks use gradient descent to find their optimal parameters.\n",

    "## What is an \"Epoch\"?\n",
    "\n",
    "An \"Epoch\" is one cycle of passing our data forward through the network, measuring error given our specified cost function, and then -via gradient descent- updating weights within our network to hopefully improve the quality of our predictions on the next iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Batch vs Minibatch vs Stochastic Gradient Descent Epochs\n",
    "\n",
    "You may have heard these variations on the training process referenced in the 3Blue1Brown videos about backpropagation. \"Minibatch\" Gradient Descent means that instead of passing all of our data through the network for a given epoch (Batch GD), we just pass a randomized portion of our data through the network for each epoch. \n",
    "\n",
    "Stochastic Gradient Descent is when we make updates to our weights after forward propagating each individual training observation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why might we use something like Minibatch GD? \n",
    "\n",
    "Neural Networks often require high quantities of training data. Consider the [MNIST Dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/):\n",
    "\n",
    "![MNIST](https://corochann.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/mnist_plot-800x600.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset is what has been used in the 3Blue1Brown videos for demonstrating important neural network concepts. The dataset has 60,000 training observations and 10,000 test observations. SInce there are 10 numeric digits that works out to be 6,000 training images per digit. Do you think our neural network needs to look at all 6000 number 3s in order to get an idea of how accurate or innacurate it is at recognizing the number 3? No, it doesn't. It's actually pretty computationally expensive to run the entire dataset through the network for each epoch, so we'll just randomly select a portion of the dataset for each training epoch.\n",
    "\n",
    "How much of the data should you pass through for each epoch? Well, you'll probably get sick of hearing this response to questions like this, but `batch_size` is another hyperparameter for our model that we'll need to tune to try and get the best results. We'll try different amounts out and try to find an optimal \"batch size.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### A note about Hyperparameters\n",
    "\n",
    "Neural Networks have many more hyperparameters than other machine learning algorithms which is part of what makes them a beast to train. 1) You need more data to train them on. 2) They're complex so they take longer to train. 3) They have lots and lots of hyperparameters which we need to find the most optimal combination of, so we might end up training our model dozens or hundreds of times with different combinations of hyperparameters in order to try and squeeze out a few more tenths of a percent of accuracy.

    "# Backpropagation\n",
    "\n",
    "Backpropagation is short for [\"Backwards Propagation of errors\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpropagation) and refers to a specific (rather calculus intensive) algorithm for how weights in a neural network are updated in reverse order at the end of each training epoch. Our purpose today is to demonstrate the backpropagation algorithm on a simple Feedforward Neural Network and in so doing help you get a grasp on the main process. If you want to understand all of the underlying calculus of how the gradients are calculated then you'll need to dive into it yourself, [3Blue1Brown's video is a great starting place](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIeHLnjs5U8). I also highly recommend this Welch Labs series [Neural Networks Demystified](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxe2T-V8XRs) if you want a rapid yet orderly walkthrough of the main intuitions and math behind the backpropagation algorithm. \n",
