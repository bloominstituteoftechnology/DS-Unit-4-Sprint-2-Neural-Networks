    "Backpropagation is short for [\"Backwards Propagation of errors\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpropagation) and refers to a specific (rather calculus intensive) algorithm for how weights in a neural network are updated in reverse order at the end of each training epoch. Our purpose today is to demonstrate the backpropagation algorithm on a simple Feedforward Neural Network and in so doing help you get a grasp on the main process. If you want to understand all of the underlying calculus of how the gradients are calculated then you'll need to dive into it yourself, [3Blue1Brown's video is a great starting place](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIeHLnjs5U8). I also highly recommend this Welch Labs series [Neural Networks Demystified](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxe2T-V8XRs) if you want a rapid yet orderly walkthrough of the main intuitions and math behind the backpropagation algorithm.
