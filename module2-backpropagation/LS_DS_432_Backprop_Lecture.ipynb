Do you think our neural network needs to look at all 6000 number 3s in order to get an idea of how accurate or innacurate it is at recognizing the number 3? No, it doesn't. It's actually pretty computationally expensive to run the entire dataset through the network for each epoch, so we'll just randomly select a portion of the dataset for each training epoch.\n",
