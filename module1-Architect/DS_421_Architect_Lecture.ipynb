This is usually done via some variation on the basic methods of **gradient descent** and **back-propagation**, which you will learn about soon!\n","\n","#### The `metric`\n","is the number we use to gauge the performance of our neural network model. In this case, we specify that we want to report model `accuracy` as our metric for each *epoch*. An *epoch* is a complete training run that uses either a subset of the data (a *mini-batch*), or all the data. In training neural networks, we usually run through multiple epochs, until the performance stops improving. We will also be able to see the overall accuracy once the model has finished training. \n","\n","#### The `optimizer` \n","Chooses which method to use in training the network. There are many optimizers available in Keras, but the **Adam Optimizer** usually gives great overall performance. Best practice: don't waste time trying out a lot of optimizers to find out which is best for your model, just pick **Adam**!\n","\n","#### Adam Optimizer\n","For more background on the **Adam** optimizer, check out these references \n","* [Adam Optimization Algorithm](https://machinelearningmastery.com/adam-optimization-algorithm-for-deep-learning/)\n","* [Adam Optimizer - original paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6980)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"ECMdYu63DWlM"},"outputs":[],"source":["model.compile(optimizer='adam', \n","              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', \n","              metrics=['accuracy'])"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ziRD3mfDDWlO","toc-hr-collapsed":false},"source":["#### 4.2.4 Fit the Neural Network Model\n","\n","Lets train the MNIST neural network model that we just built to predict the digit classes! `model.fit()` has a `batch_size` parameter that we can use if we want to do *mini-batch* epochs, but since this tabular dataset is pretty small we'll use the default value `batch_size = None` so that each epoch will consist of the entire batch of input data.
