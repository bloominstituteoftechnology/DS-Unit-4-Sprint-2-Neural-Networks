# NOTES

> I increased memory from 4098 (or whatever 4Gb is in binary)
Files: Max Memory For Large Files MB
Controls the memory available to VS Code after restart when trying to open large files. Same effect as specifying --max-memory=NEWSIZE on the command line.\

## Use ReLu. Its simple.  Linear _ + Linear / = _/ non-linear (neural)

The first part of the Lecture we didnt go over a lot of.  We need to learn all this solid.

R-Square is based on the errors.  This is called Loss/Cost function.

Forward Propagation / Back Propagation. KNOW THESE.  Its very IMPORTANT.
Know how to calculate Loss function in your head.  Its easy to do.
Cross-entropy
Again Loss function is very IMPORTANT to know well.

Be SURE to go over saved links in each module!

Removing .models makes this import work in WSL!
from tensorflow.keras import Sequential

input_dim is only in the first layer.  After that its without the term but just write the number.  They increase.

Look into SVM if have time.  Watch video.

callbacks = ([tensorboard_callbacks])

PANDARALLEL
from pandarallel import pandarallel
pandarallel.initialize(nb_workers=8, progress_bar=True)
# df.apply(func)
# df.parallel_apply(func)
# so that the progress bars will work
from pandarallel import progress_bars
# Might need this?
progress_bars.is_notebook_lab = lambda : True
