    "### The Gradient - a multi-dimensional derivative\n",
    "Once you've watched the previous video, you are now set up to  understand how to conceptualize a derivative in an N-dimensional space (where N is any number ranging from 2, 3, 4, ..., all the way to a very large number of dimensions N ) [**This video visually explains the multi-dimensional derivative called the Gradient visually**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkB4vW16QHI) - and that's the take away. This point of this video is to help you understand the Gradient visually using 3D surfaces. You should also know that the Gradient is made of up partial derivatives, more on this tomorrow. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Contour Maps \n",
    "It is very common to visual 3D surfaces as 2D contour maps - and we'll be making a lot of use of contour maps to understand Gradient Descent. Watch this video in order to [**understand the relationship between 3D surfaces and 2D contour maps**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acdX4YamDtU)\n",

    "### The Calculus of Backpropagation \n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike standard Sklearn ML models, neural networks use not just Gradient Descent but also something called Backpropagatin in order to learn from the data. [**In order to understand how backpropagation works, you need to understand the Chain Rule in Calculus**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acdX4YamDtU). The take away here is to understand how a partial derivative can be decomposed into a product of multiple derivatives. "
