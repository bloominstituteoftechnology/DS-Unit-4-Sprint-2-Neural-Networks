        "You'll need to know when you should build something from scratch and when to use an open-source solution in the industry. The rule of thumb is don't build it if someone else already has because maintaining the code and fixing bugs is something that other developers (i.e., the open-source community) can spend their time on, and you don't have to. But if an open-source solution doesn't exist for a solution you need, you'll need to build it or try an alternative solution.\n",
