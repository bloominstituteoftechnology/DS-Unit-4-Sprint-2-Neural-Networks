    "- Instantiate a model object and use `model.add()` to add layers to your model\n",
    "- Since this is a regression model you will have a single output node in the final layer.\n",
    "- Use activation functions that are appropriate for this task\n",
    "- Compile your model\n",
    "- Fit your model and report its accuracy in terms of Mean Squared Error\n",

    "- Run this same data through a linear regression model. Which achieves higher accuracy?\n",
    "- Do a little bit of feature engineering and see how that affects your neural network model. (you will need to change your model to accept more inputs)\n",
    "- After feature engineering, which model sees a greater accuracy boost due to the new features?"
