    "## Define the Following:\n",
    "You can add image, diagrams, whatever you need to ensure that you understand the concepts below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Input Layer: \n",
    "The Input Layer is what receives input from our dataset. Sometimes it is called the visible layer because it's the only part that is exposed to our data and that our data interacts with directly. Typically node maps are drawn with one input node for each of the different inputs/features/columns of our dataset that will be passed to the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hidden Layer:\n",
    "Layers after the input layer are called Hidden Layers. This is because they cannot be accessed except through the input layer. They're inside of the network and they perform their functions, but we don't directly interact with them. The simplest possible network is to have a single neuron in the hidden layer that just outputs the value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output Layer:\n",
    "The final layer is called the Output Layer. The purpose of the output layer is to output a vector of values that is in a format that is suitable for the type of problem that we're trying to address. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Neuron:\n",
    "\"Nodes\" that receive inputs and pass on their signal to the next layer of nodes if a certain threshold is reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Weight:\n",
    "Refers to a strength or amplitude of a connection between two nodes (the amount of influence the firing of one neuron has on another). Also, the importance of an input.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Activation Function:\n",
    "In Neural Networks, each node has an activation function. Each node in a given layer typically has the same activation function. These activation functions are the biggest piece of neural networks that have been inspired by actual biology. The activation function decides whether a cell \"fires\" or not. Sometimes it is said that the cell is \"activated\" or not. In Artificial Neural Networks activation functions decide how much signal to pass onto the next layer. This is why they are sometimes referred to as transfer functions because they determine how much signal is transferred to the next layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Node Map:\n",
    "A visual diagram of the architecture or \"topology\" of the neural network. It's kind of like a flow chart in that it shows the path from inputs to outputs. They are usually color coded and help us understand at a very high level, some of the differences in architecture between kinds of neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Perceptron:\n",
    "A perceptron is just a single node or neuron of a neural network with nothing else. It can take any number of inputs and spit out an output. What a neuron does is it takes each of the input values, multplies each of them by a weight, sums all of these products up, and then passes the sum through what is called an \"activation function\" the result of which is the final value."
