    "Neural Networks are a whole new area of study and application that can be intimidating, but which represents some of the most powerful tools and techniques that we possess in machine learning today. In spite of the hype surrounding these topics I hope that you will come to see them as just another tool in your toolbag with their own strengths and weaknesses. They are useful, but they are not a silver bullet, and they are not always preferable to other -perhaps more simple- machine learning methods. \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this week is to familiarize you with the fundamental theory, terminology and libraries that will enable you to approach different neural network architectures (called topologies) in a sophisticated manner. This week will not be a run-through of the history of Neural Networks and each of the individual advancements leading up to current technologies -we don't have time for that. We will spend some time on some older methods, but only to the degree that they will help introduce us to relevant terminology and understand more complex versions of these technologies.\n",

    "Neural Networks aren't exactly a new technology, but recent breakthroughs have revitalized the area. For example the \"Perceptron\" -one of the basic building blocks of the technology- was invented in 1957. \n",
    "\n",
    "Artificial Neural Networks are a computational model that was inspired by how neural networks in the brain process information. In the brain electrochemical signals flow from earlier neurons through the dendrites of the cell toward the cell body. If the received signals surpass a certain threshold with a given timing then the neuron fires sending a large spike of energy down the axon and through the axon terminals to other neurons down the line. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Artificial Neural Networks the neurons or \"nodes\" are similar in that they receive inputs and pass on their signal to the next layer of nodes if a certain threshold is reached, but that's about where the similarities end. Remember that ANNs are not brains. Don't fall into the common trap of assuming that if an Artificial Neural Network has as many nodes as the human brain that it will be just as powerful or just as capable. The goal with ANNs is not to create a realistic model of the brain but to craft robust algorithms and data structures that can model the complex relationships found in data."

I also want to elaborate a little bit on what he has written."

    "### Types of Layers:\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three main types of neuron layers in a typical NN topology:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Input or Visible Layers\n",
    "\n",
    "The Input Layer is what receives input from our dataset. Sometimes it is called the visible layer because it's the only part that is exposed to our data and that our data interacts with directly. Typically node maps are drawn with one input node for each of the different inputs/features/columns of our dataset that will be passed to the network. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Hidden Layers\n",
    "\n",
    "Layers after the input layer are called Hidden Layers. This is because they cannot be accessed except through the input layer. They're inside of the network and they perform their functions, but we don't directly interact with them. The simplest possible network is to have a single neuron in the hidden layer that just outputs the value. \"Deep Learning\" apart from being a big buzzword simply means that we are using a Neural Network that has multiple hidden layers. \"Deep Learning\" is a big part of the renewed hype around ANNs because it allows networks that are structured in specific ways to accomplish tasks that were previously out of reach (image recognition for example).  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Output Layers\n",
    "\n",
    "The final layer is called the Output Layer. The purpose of the output layer is to output a vector of values that is in a format that is suitable for the type of problem that we're trying to address. Typically the output value is modified by an \"activation function\" to transform it into a format that makes sense for our context, here's a couple of examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "- NNs applied to a regression problem might have a single output node with no activation function because what we want is an unbounded continuous value.\n",
    "\n",
    "- NNS applied to a binary classification problem might use a sigmoid function as its activation function in order to squishify values down to represent a probability. Outputs in this case would represent the probability of predicting the primary class of interest. We can turn this into a class-specific prediction by rounding the outputted sigmoid probability up to 1 or down to 0. \n",
    "\n",
    "- NNS applied to multiclass classification problems might have multiple output nodes in the output layer, one for each class that we're trying to predict. This output layer would probably employ what's called a \"softmax function\" for accomplishing this. Don't worry about how that activation function works just yet, we'll get to it soon."

    "Now, we didn't fit this line using any regression techniques so it's likely that it's **not** the line of best fit. But we could try out other lines and see if the error gets bigger or smaller. Well it just so happens that in this two dimensional world that if our line is stuck to the origin on one end then we don't have all of the freedom that we want to control our predictions. We need some way to slide it up and down the y axis so that we can make any line that we want in this two-dimensional world. This y-intercept is a constant value, or in other words it's always weighted by 1. We're going to call this y-intercept our \"bias\" term. We'll define this a little bit better in a minute. \n",

While it is true that we can fit non-linear features using linear regression as we include polynomial features, the reality is that in order to fit really curvy nonlinear patterns in data in really complex high dimensional features spaces, the number of polynomial terms that we would have to include in a linear or logistic regression model faces a problem of combinatorial explosion in terms of the number of features that would be required. \n",

It can take any number of inputs and spit out an output. What a neuron does is it takes each of the input values, multplies each of them by a weight, sums all of these products up, and then passes the sum through what is called an \"activation function\" the result of which is the final value.\n",

Sometimes it is said that the cell is \"activated\" or not. In Artificial Neural Networks activation functions decide how much signal to pass onto the next layer.
